👋 Hi, I’m @kzaky!

☁️ I am a Sr. Product Manager at [AWS - Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com).

👨‍💻 I am responsible for [AWS Identity](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/) products such as user authentication, sign-in, and multi-factor authentication for [AWS - Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com).

👨‍🏫 I teach a Product Management class at [Brainstation](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/learn-from-a-real-product-manager-at-brainstation-khaled-zaky) in the evenings and weekends.

🤔 I’m interested in all things cloud, identity, and product management.

👀 I'm looking to collaborate on improving authentication for workforce and enterprise customers.

🎯 My goal is to enable customers to easily adopt more secure authentication solutions such as FIDO security keys.
